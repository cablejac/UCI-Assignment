Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project This is the course project
for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script,
run\_analysis.R, does the following (note: requires Plyr package):

1.  Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working
    directory
2.  Merges data files into one data frame
3.  Extracts data that relates to mean or standard deviation
4.  Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
5.  Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each
    variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
